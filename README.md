# Project Pulse

A web application for managing weekly activity reports (WAR) and peer evaluations in TCU's senior design courses.

## Problem

The current process for submitting and grading WARs and peer evaluations relies on Google Sheets, Excel spreadsheets, and manual file transfers through the university's LMS. This workflow is time-consuming, error-prone, and creates a heavy manual burden for both students and instructors.

## Solution

Project Pulse consolidates the entire workflow into a single web application where:

- **Students** submit weekly activity reports and peer evaluations directly in the system
- **Instructors** view reports, review peer evaluations, and access automatically generated grades and feedback
- **Admins** manage senior design sections, teams, and student/instructor assignments

## Key Features

- Manage senior design sections, teams, students, and instructors
- Submit and track weekly activity reports
- Submit peer evaluations with rubric-based scoring
- Generate peer evaluation and WAR reports automatically

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Vue 3 + Vite
- **Backend:** Spring Boot (Java 17+)
- **Database:** MySQL
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
- **Deployment:** Microsoft Azure
